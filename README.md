# Hey there! 👋 Welcome to My GitHub

I'm **Angga**, a passionate **Full Stack Web Developer** with over a decade of experience in building and optimizing web applications. From crafting beautiful front-end designs to making sure the back-end runs like a well-oiled machine, I love taking on challenges and delivering top-notch results.

## 💻 What I Do

- **Frontend Magic** 🪄: Vue.js, React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and a bit of Angular to make things pop.
- **Backend Wizardry** 🔧: PHP, Node.js, Python, Laravel, MySQL, Postgresql, and MongoDB to keep the server-side smooth and scalable.
- **CMS Mastery** 🛠️: WordPress, WooCommerce, Django CMS, Shopify—you name it, I can probably make it work.
- **Build & Deploy** 🚀: Git, GitHub, and the usual suspects to get things up and running without a hitch.


## 🚀 Projects I’ve Worked On

I’ve been lucky to work on a variety of cool projects, from developing fully customized eCommerce platforms to building APIs and creating unique solutions for businesses around the world. Here are some highlights:

- Built an eCommerce platform on **Django CMS** that automates deployments and plugin installations.
- Helped a healthcare startup redesign their site, boosting performance and UX using **JavaScript**, **PHP**, and **MySQL**.
- As a startup founder, I launched and scaled fully customized eCommerce stores on WooCommerce and WordPress. I didn’t just use pre-built themes and plugins—I crafted unique, tailor-made solutions that enhanced customer experience and optimized sales processes. Through extensive customization of themes, plugins, and site functionalities, my work made it almost impossible to tell these stores were powered by WordPress and WooCommerce. I also drove successful digital marketing campaigns using Google Ads and Facebook Ads, alongside SEO strategies that boosted online visibility and conversions.
